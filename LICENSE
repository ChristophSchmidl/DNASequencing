DNA Sequencer

A simple program which reads in a file which contains a dna-sequence of the following character:

'a' - adenine
'g' - guanine
'c' - cytosine
't' - thymine

The program enables the user the search for certain patterns by using regular expressions. A short analysis of the following diseases and features is also possible and can be easily extended by writing new 'queries':

- Nucleobases
- Complementary sequence
- Brown eyes
- Tyberius Syndrome
- Fromingen's Dischrypsia
